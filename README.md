# Semestral Work
## **About**
First Semestral work at first course second semester KFU HS ITIS - implementation of Polinom of three variables.
**Warning!!!** Please never use this code for your safety :)
## **Javadoc**
Also you can see [Polinom3 API](https://anteeone.github.io/Semestral-Work/javadoc/index.html)
## **Difficulty**
### **O(N):**
- **delete**
- **value**
- **derivative**
- **insert**
- **toString**
### **O(N^2):**
- **constructor**
- **add**


## Plots:
On this plots , which are made with using **"matplotlib" Python** module.
Some plots not very accurate ,
but they can show difficulty of methods
